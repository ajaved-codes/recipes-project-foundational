    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>
      This chicken fra diavolo is chicken thighs in my version of fra diavolo
      sauce, the spicy Italian pepper and tomato sauce with fresh herbs and
      white wine, usually used with seafood. We like spicy, and I wondered, “why
      not chicken?” We liked it with crusty bread, to get every last drop of the
      sauce.
